# Il Quaderno di Paolo Bufalini Web application design

The goal of the project is to rethink the Web application of a Semantic Scholarly Digital Edition, specifically the one of Il Quaderno di Paolo Bufalini Semantic Scholarly Digital Edition, designing specific interactive tools to allow users effective visualisation, browsing, information seeking, manipulation, and interpretation of LOD semantic data, extracted from the dataset underlying the Semantic Scholarly Digital Edition at hand.

In this way, it is intended to enhance the generous ethos and conceptual complexity of a Semantic Scholarly Digital Edition.
The process of redefining the Web application of a semantic edition has been carried out in terms of Usability and User Experience, having as reference the goal-oriented model proposed by James Garrett. 

Focusing first on the problems related to the transition process from Scholarly Digital Edition to Semantic Scholarly Digital Edition, and on the peculiar features of the dataset underlying the edition of Il Quaderno di Paolo Bufalini to be enhanced in the design stage, we have moved towards the redesign of the Web application at hand, which has as its final output a series of mock-ups that show the tools designed to effectively enhance the LOD semantics.
